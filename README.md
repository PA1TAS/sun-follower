============

Following the sun with ChipKit and Arduino 

I do hope that this will work out. Seing that the arduino has 6 pwm's and the chipkit only has 5. So I'm learning also to use "interrupt's" and "Analog Pin's" and also how to config every thing using "C".

Those whom want to help are always welcome.

And as you can see I'm not an English man but a real Boer from South Africa that lives in The Netherlands so if my english isn't up to standerd SORRY :P
